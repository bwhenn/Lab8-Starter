How are graceful degradation and service workers related?: 
Service workers are related to graceful degradation because it allows for a baseline functionality of the website even when crutial components such as network are unavailble. By caching important assets and serving them from local storage, service workers ensure that users can still access core features of a website offline or during intermittent connectivity. This approach is essential for creating resilient web experiences that degrade gracefully under adverse conditions, providing a seamless user experience
